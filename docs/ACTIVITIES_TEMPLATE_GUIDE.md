Marcus Aurelius Quote    reflection    You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think. - Marcus Aurelius
```

## Tips for Success

1. **Categories**: Try to use consistent categories across your activities
2. **Icons**: Choose emojis that visually represent your activities well
3. **Frequency**: Be realistic about frequency - yearly (1/year), monthly (12/year), weekly (52/year), daily (365/year)
4. **Names**: Keep names concise but descriptive
5. **Financial Unit**: Choose the most appropriate unit (month, year, visit, meal, etc.)

## Running the Conversion Script

After updating your Google Sheets, you'll need to run the conversion script:

1. Make sure your Google Sheet is publicly accessible (or shared with the script user)
2. Copy your Google Sheet URL
3. Run the conversion script with your sheet URL:
   ```
   python scripts/convert_activities_sheets_to_json.py --sheet-url YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_URL
   ```

The script will generate a JSON file with all your activities, financial items, and quotes ready for use in the Finitude app.
